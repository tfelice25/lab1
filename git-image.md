# Exercise 2: add image to git

This exercise asks you to add a folder to your repo, and thereafter
image to that folder.  And finally commit everything to github!

1. make a new folder (e.g. _images_) to this repo.  Hint: `mkdir`

   mkdir images

2. ensure that the folder is there.  Hint: `ls`

   ls (it's there)

3. download an image you like and save it into the image dir you made
   above.
   
   ballet.jpg
   
4. on command line navigate to the image folder.  Hint: `cd`

  cd images

5. ensure that the image is there.  Hint: `ls`

    ls (it's there)

6. add the image to your git repo.  Hint: `git add image.jpg`

  git add ballet.jpeg

7. commit and push the changes.  Hint: `git commit -am ".. your
   message here.. ".
   
  git commit -am "commited ballet image"
   
8. go and check on github that the image is there.

   done

9. as before, edit this file and write here the commands you used.
   Hint: you have to do the edits and commit again, in a similar
   fashion as above.
   
   > add an image to the images subfolder of lab1
   > ls to ensure its there
   > add and commit with git add image.jpg and then git commit -am "commit      message"

Did the edits show up on github?
